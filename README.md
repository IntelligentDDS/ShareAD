## On the Practicability of Deep Learning based Anomaly Detection for Modern Online Systems: A Pre-Train-and-Align Framework

This work extends upon our previous work ``Share or Not Share? Towards the Practicability of Deep Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Modern Online Systems'' at the 33rd IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2022), which is also honored to get the best paper award in the research track.
